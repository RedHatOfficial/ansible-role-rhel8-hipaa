Profile Description:  
The HIPAA Security Rule establishes U.S. national standards to protect individualsâ€™

confidentiality, integrity, and security of electronic protected health  
information.  
  
This profile configures Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 to the HIPAA Security  
Rule identified for securing of electronic protected health information.  

The tasks that are used in this role are generated using OpenSCAP.
